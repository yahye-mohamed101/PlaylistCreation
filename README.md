    TuneForge is an innovative interactive platform that allows users to create (or "forge") songs based on their chosen artist and song title, generating a link to the selected song. Users can also create playlists and seamlessly drag their newly forged songs into their custom collections.

- Recently Forged Section<br>
    Newly created links are displayed in the "Recently Forged" section, featuring two interactive buttons: one for adding the tune to a playlist (Feature 4) and another labeled "Reforge," which allows users to modify the song's details if necessary. The updated song link will then reflect in the "Recently Forged" section.<br>
